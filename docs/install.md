# How to install Billboard

## The easy way : Tools module
Billboard can be installed using the ['Tools' module](https://www.impresscms.org/modules/downloads/singledownload.php?download_id=34&file=tools&category_id=3).

## The less easy way : manual
Billboard is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /billboard folder into the /modules directory of your website.

Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Billboard icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon.

Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
